## Setup

This project is set up already and running on a cloud environment, as well as a convex development in the sandbox.

## Environment Variables

The project is set up with project specific CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and VITE_CONVEX_URL environment variables on the client side.

The convex server has a separate set of environment variables that are accessible by the convex backend.

Currently, these variables include auth-specific keys: JWKS, JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, and SITE_URL.
